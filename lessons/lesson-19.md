# Lesson 19: Introduction to Classes and Objects

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Understand the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
2. Define classes in Python
3. Create objects (instances of classes)
4. Define and use attributes in classes
5. Create a simple "Pet" class with basic attributes and methods

## Materials Needed
- Computers with Python and Visual Studio Code installed
- Projector or screen sharing capability
- Prepared code examples demonstrating class and object concepts

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Introduction to OOP (15 minutes)
- Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming
- Discuss the benefits of OOP (e.g., code organization, reusability)
- Introduce key OOP terms: class, object, attribute, method
- Use VS Code's whiteboard extension to visualize OOP concepts

### 2. Defining Classes (20 minutes)
- Demonstrate how to define a basic class in Python
- Explain the purpose of the `__init__` method
- Show how to add attributes to a class
- Use VS Code's IntelliSense to explore class definition syntax

### 3. Creating Objects (20 minutes)
- Show how to create objects (instances) from a class
- Demonstrate accessing and modifying object attributes
- Explain the difference between class and instance attributes
- Use VS Code's debugger to inspect object properties

### 4. Adding Methods to Classes (25 minutes)
- Explain what methods are and how they differ from functions
- Demonstrate defining methods within a class
- Introduce the `self` parameter and its purpose
- Show how to call methods on objects
- Use VS Code's refactoring tools to extract methods from existing code

### 5. Hands-on Practice: Creating a Pet Class (30 minutes)
Guide students in creating a simple "Pet" class:
1. Create a new Python file in VS Code
2. Define a Pet class with attributes for name, animal type, and age
3. Add an `__init__` method to initialize these attributes
4. Create methods for making a sound and celebrating a birthday
5. Instantiate several Pet objects and demonstrate their methods
6. Use VS Code's integrated terminal to test the Pet class

### 6. Wrap-up and Homework Introduction (10 minutes)
- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Introduce the homework assignment: Expand the Pet class (e.g., add more attributes, create additional methods)
- Preview the next lesson's topic (methods and self in more detail)

## Additional Resources
- Visual Studio Code Python Tutorial: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_create-a-python-hello-world-source-code-file
- Python's official documentation on classes: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Forgetting to use `self` in method definitions: Emphasize its importance in accessing object attributes
- Confusion between class and instance attributes: Provide clear examples of each
- Difficulty understanding the `__init__` method: Explain its role as a constructor

## Extension Activities
For students who finish early or want extra challenges:
- Create a class to represent a basic geometry shape (e.g., Rectangle) with methods to calculate area and perimeter
- Implement a simple bank account class with methods for deposit and withdrawal
- Experiment with creating a class to represent a deck of cards

Encourage students to use VS Code's "Python Docstring Generator" extension to practice writing documentation for their classes and methods. Demonstrate how well-documented code can make understanding and using classes easier.
