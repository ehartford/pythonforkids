# Lesson 1: Introduction to Python and Setting Up the Environment

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Explain what Python is and its common uses
2. Install Python on their computers
3. Set up and use Visual Studio Code for Python development
4. Write and run a basic "Hello, World!" program in VS Code

## Materials Needed
- Computers with internet access for each student
- Projector or screen sharing capability
- Python installation files (if internet access is limited)
- Visual Studio Code installation files

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
- Introduce yourself and the course
- Briefly explain what programming is and why Python is a great language to learn
- Show examples of what can be created with Python (websites, games, data analysis, etc.)

### 2. What is Python? (15 minutes)
- Explain the history of Python (created by Guido van Rossum in 1991)
- Discuss Python's philosophy (readability, simplicity)
- Highlight popular uses of Python (web development, data science, AI, automation)
- Briefly mention different versions of Python (focus on Python 3)

### 3. Installing Python (20 minutes)
- Guide students through downloading Python from python.org
- Walk through the installation process step-by-step
- Ensure all students have successfully installed Python
- Verify installation by running Python in the command prompt/terminal

### 4. Introduction to Visual Studio Code (20 minutes)
- Explain what Visual Studio Code is and its benefits for Python development
- Guide students through downloading and installing VS Code
- Show how to install the Python extension in VS Code
- Demonstrate how to set up a Python project in VS Code

### 5. Writing Your First Program (15 minutes)
- Introduce the concept of "Hello, World!" as a traditional first program
- Demonstrate how to create a new Python file in VS Code
- Show how to write the program: `print("Hello, World!")`
- Explain the `print()` function briefly
- Demonstrate how to run Python code directly in VS Code

### 6. Experimentation and Q&A (15 minutes)
- Encourage students to experiment with the `print()` function in VS Code
- Show how to use VS Code's integrated terminal for quick Python experiments
- Demonstrate printing multiple lines, numbers, and simple calculations
- Answer any questions that have come up during the lesson

### 7. Wrap-up and Homework (10 minutes)
- Recap what was learned in the lesson
- Explain the homework assignment: Write a program that prints a short introduction about themselves
- Show how to save Python files in VS Code and organize their project folder
- Preview what will be covered in the next lesson

## Additional Resources
- Python's official website: https://www.python.org/
- Visual Studio Code documentation: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs
- VS Code Python tutorial: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Installation problems: Have a troubleshooting guide ready for common installation issues on different operating systems
- VS Code setup issues: Ensure the Python extension is properly installed and configured
- Running code: Make sure students understand how to use VS Code's Run Python File button or integrated terminal

## Extension Activities
For students who finish early or want extra challenges:
- Write a program that prints an ASCII art picture using multiple print statements
- Experiment with printing different types of data (numbers, strings, calculations)
- Try to find and fix deliberate errors in sample code using VS Code's error highlighting

Remember to maintain an encouraging and inclusive atmosphere. Emphasize that making mistakes is a normal and valuable part of the learning process in programming.
