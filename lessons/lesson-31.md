# Lesson 31: Introduction to Pygame

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Understand the basics of game development and Pygame's role
2. Set up a Pygame development environment in VS Code
3. Create a basic game window and game loop
4. Draw simple shapes and images on the game window
5. Handle basic events in Pygame
6. Implement a simple animation

## Materials Needed
- Computers with Python, Pygame, and Visual Studio Code installed
- Python extension for VS Code
- Projector or screen sharing capability
- Prepared Pygame code examples
- Simple image files for sprites

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Introduction to Game Development and Pygame (15 minutes)
- Explain the basics of game development
- Introduce Pygame and its features
- Demonstrate installing Pygame using pip in VS Code's integrated terminal
- Show how to import Pygame and check its version

### 2. Setting Up a Pygame Project (20 minutes)
- Create a new Python file for the Pygame project
- Show how to initialize Pygame
- Demonstrate creating a game window
- Explain the concept of a game loop
- Use VS Code's Python extension to run and debug Pygame scripts

### 3. Drawing Shapes and Images (25 minutes)
- Show how to draw basic shapes (rectangles, circles, lines)
- Demonstrate loading and displaying images
- Explain the Pygame coordinate system
- Introduce the concept of surfaces in Pygame
- Use VS Code's image preview feature to check game assets

### 4. Handling Events (20 minutes)
- Explain the Pygame event system
- Show how to handle keyboard events
- Demonstrate handling mouse events
- Implement closing the game window
- Use VS Code's debugger to inspect event objects

### 5. Basic Animation (30 minutes)
- Explain the concept of animation in games
- Show how to move objects on the screen
- Demonstrate using the Pygame clock to control frame rate
- Implement simple collision detection
- Use VS Code's multi-cursor editing to efficiently update coordinate values

### 6. Hands-on Practice: Creating a Simple Game (30 minutes)
Guide students in creating a basic game:
1. Set up a game window with a background color
2. Create a player-controlled object (e.g., a rectangle or loaded image)
3. Implement movement of the player object using keyboard input
4. Add a collectible item that the player can interact with
5. Implement a simple scoring system
6. Use VS Code's integrated terminal to run and test the game

### 7. Wrap-up and Homework Introduction (10 minutes)
- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Introduce the homework assignment: Enhance the simple game (e.g., add obstacles, improve graphics)
- Preview the next lesson's topic (Sprite and Event Handling in Pygame)

## Additional Resources
- Pygame Documentation: https://www.pygame.org/docs/
- VS Code Pygame Debugging: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Pygame installation issues: Provide troubleshooting steps for common installation problems
- Coordinate system confusion: Clarify the top-left origin and axis directions
- Frame rate and game speed issues: Explain the importance of using clock.tick()

## Extension Activities
- Implement background scrolling in the game
- Add sound effects to game events
- Create a simple particle system for visual effects

Encourage students to use VS Code's "Python Docstring Generator" extension to document their Pygame functions. Demonstrate how clear documentation can help in understanding game logic and structure.
