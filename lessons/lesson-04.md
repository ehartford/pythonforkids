# Lesson 4: If Statements

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Understand and use boolean expressions
2. Implement simple if statements
3. Use if-else statements for decision making
4. Implement elif (else if) statements for multiple conditions
5. Create a simple guessing game using if statements in VS Code

## Materials Needed
- Computers with Python and Visual Studio Code installed
- Python extension for VS Code
- Projector or screen sharing capability
- Prepared code examples

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Review (10 minutes)
- Recap the previous lesson on input and output
- Address any questions from the homework
- Quick quiz on input/output concepts using VS Code's Live Share feature

### 2. Introduction to Boolean Expressions (15 minutes)
- Explain what boolean expressions are
- Introduce comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Demonstrate how to use these operators
- Introduce logical operators (and, or, not)
- Use VS Code's integrated terminal to test boolean expressions

### 3. Simple If Statements (20 minutes)
- Explain the concept of conditional execution
- Introduce the syntax of if statements
- Demonstrate creating and using simple if statements
- Emphasize the importance of indentation in Python
- Show how VS Code helps with proper indentation

### 4. If-Else Statements (20 minutes)
- Extend the concept to if-else statements
- Show how to use if-else for binary decisions
- Provide examples of real-world uses of if-else statements
- Guide students through creating a simple program using if-else
- Use VS Code's code snippets to quickly create if-else structures

### 5. Elif Statements (20 minutes)
- Introduce elif for handling multiple conditions
- Demonstrate the syntax and usage of elif
- Show how to chain multiple conditions using elif
- Discuss the order of evaluation in if-elif-else chains
- Use VS Code's multi-cursor editing to efficiently create elif chains

### 6. Hands-on Practice: Simple Guessing Game (15 minutes)
- Guide students in creating a number guessing game that:
  1. Generates a random number (introduce the random module)
  2. Asks the user to guess the number
  3. Uses if-elif-else to tell if the guess is too high, too low, or correct
- Demonstrate how to use VS Code's debugger to step through the game logic

### 7. Wrap-up and Homework Introduction (10 minutes)
- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Introduce the homework assignment: Expand the guessing game to include multiple guesses and provide hints
- Preview the next lesson's topic (while loops)
- Show how to use VS Code's source control features to commit their work

## Additional Resources
- Python's official documentation on control flow: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html
- VS Code Python tutorial: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Confusion between = and == : VS Code's syntax highlighting helps distinguish these
- Indentation errors: Show how VS Code's automatic indentation can help avoid these issues
- Logical errors in complex conditions: Use VS Code's debugger to step through code and examine variable values

## Extension Activities
For students who finish early or want extra challenges:
- Create a simple adventure game using if statements for decision making
- Implement a basic calculator that performs different operations based on user input
- Write a program that determines if a year is a leap year using if-elif-else statements

Remember to encourage experimentation and problem-solving. Allow time for students to share their programs and discuss different approaches to solving problems using if statements. Demonstrate how VS Code's features can help in writing and debugging these programs efficiently.
