# Lesson 5: While Loops

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Understand the concept of loops and their importance in programming
2. Implement and use while loops
3. Use while loops for input validation
4. Understand and use break and continue statements
5. Create a countdown program using a while loop in VS Code

## Materials Needed
- Computers with Python and Visual Studio Code installed
- Python extension for VS Code
- Projector or screen sharing capability
- Prepared code examples

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Review (10 minutes)
- Recap the previous lesson on if statements
- Address any questions from the homework (guessing game)
- Quick quiz on if statements and boolean expressions using VS Code's Live Share feature

### 2. Introduction to Loops (15 minutes)
- Explain the concept of loops and why they're useful
- Discuss real-world examples of repetitive tasks
- Introduce the while loop as a way to repeat code
- Show how to create a new Python file in VS Code for loop examples

### 3. Basic While Loops (20 minutes)
- Demonstrate the syntax of a while loop
- Show how to create a simple counter using a while loop
- Emphasize the importance of the loop condition
- Discuss infinite loops and how to avoid them
- Use VS Code's debugger to step through loop iterations

### 4. Input Validation with While Loops (20 minutes)
- Explain the concept of input validation
- Demonstrate using a while loop to ensure valid user input
- Guide students through creating a program that asks for a number within a specific range
- Show how to use VS Code's integrated terminal to test input validation

### 5. Break and Continue Statements (20 minutes)
- Introduce the break statement to exit a loop early
- Show how to use continue to skip to the next iteration
- Provide examples of when to use break and continue
- Discuss the impact on code readability and flow
- Use VS Code's IntelliSense to explore loop-related keywords

### 6. Hands-on Practice: Countdown Program (15 minutes)
- Guide students in creating a countdown program that:
  1. Asks the user for a starting number
  2. Counts down from that number to 1, printing each number
  3. Prints "Blastoff!" when it reaches 0
  4. Uses a while loop to implement the countdown
- Demonstrate how to use VS Code's Run and Debug feature to test the program

### 7. Wrap-up and Homework Introduction (10 minutes)
- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Introduce the homework assignment: Create a simple menu-driven program using a while loop for the main program loop
- Preview the next lesson's topic (for loops)
- Show how to use VS Code's code folding feature to organize longer programs

## Additional Resources
- Python's official documentation on while statements: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement
- VS Code Python debugging: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Infinite loops: Use VS Code's "Stop" button to terminate runaway programs
- Off-by-one errors: Demonstrate using VS Code's variable hover to check values during debugging
- Confusion between when to use if statements vs. loops: Use VS Code's comment feature to add explanatory notes in code

## Extension Activities
For students who finish early or want extra challenges:
- Create a simple text-based game (like rock-paper-scissors) that uses a while loop for multiple rounds
- Implement a program that calculates compound interest over time using a while loop
- Write a program that generates a random walk using a while loop

Encourage students to think about everyday processes that involve repetition and how they might implement these using while loops. Foster an environment where students can share their code and discuss different approaches to solving problems using VS Code's Live Share feature for collaborative coding.
