# Lesson 7: Defining and Calling Functions

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Understand the concept and importance of functions in programming
2. Define and call simple functions
3. Work with function parameters and return values
4. Understand variable scope within functions
5. Create a program with multiple functions to calculate areas of different shapes

## Materials Needed
- Computers with Python and IDLE installed
- Projector or screen sharing capability
- Prepared code examples

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Review (10 minutes)
- Recap the previous lesson on for loops
- Address any questions from the homework (shape drawing program)
- Quick quiz on loops and their applications

### 2. Introduction to Functions (15 minutes)
- Explain what functions are and why they're useful
- Discuss the concept of code reusability
- Show examples of built-in functions students have already used (print(), input(), etc.)
- Introduce the basic syntax for defining a function

### 3. Defining and Calling Simple Functions (20 minutes)
- Demonstrate how to define a simple function without parameters
- Show how to call a function
- Explain the difference between defining and calling a function
- Guide students through creating and calling their own simple functions

### 4. Function Parameters and Return Values (25 minutes)
- Introduce the concept of function parameters
- Show how to define functions with one or more parameters
- Explain the importance of return values
- Demonstrate using the return statement
- Guide students in creating functions that take parameters and return values

### 5. Variable Scope (15 minutes)
- Explain the concept of variable scope
- Discuss local vs. global variables
- Show examples of how variable scope works within functions
- Demonstrate potential pitfalls with variable naming

### 6. Hands-on Practice: Area Calculator (15 minutes)
- Guide students in creating a program that:
  1. Defines functions to calculate areas of different shapes (circle, square, triangle)
  2. Takes user input for shape choice and necessary measurements
  3. Calls the appropriate function and displays the result

### 7. Wrap-up and Homework Introduction (10 minutes)
- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Introduce the homework assignment: Expand the area calculator to include volume calculations for 3D shapes
- Preview the next lesson's topic (built-in functions and importing modules)

## Additional Resources
- "Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 7 - Recycling Your Code with Functions and Modules (first half)
- Python's official documentation on defining functions: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Confusion between defining and calling functions: Provide clear examples of each
- Forgetting to use return statements: Emphasize the difference between returning and printing
- Issues with variable scope: Demonstrate how to properly use global variables if necessary

## Extension Activities
For students who finish early or want extra challenges:
- Create a simple calculator program that uses functions for each operation
- Implement a temperature conversion program with functions for different conversions
- Write a program that uses recursive functions to calculate factorials

Encourage students to think about how they can break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts using functions. Facilitate discussions about code organization and the benefits of using functions in larger programs.
