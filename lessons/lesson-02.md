# Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Understand what variables are and how to use them
2. Identify and use different data types (integers, floats, strings)
3. Perform basic arithmetic operations in Python
4. Create a simple calculator program using VS Code

## Materials Needed
- Computers with Python and Visual Studio Code installed
- Projector or screen sharing capability
- Prepared code examples

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Review (10 minutes)
- Briefly recap the previous lesson
- Review any questions from the homework
- Quick quiz on basic Python concepts (e.g., How do you print something in Python?)

### 2. Introduction to Variables (20 minutes)
- Explain what variables are (containers for storing data)
- Demonstrate how to create and use variables in Python
- Explain variable naming rules and conventions
- Show how to reassign values to variables
- Use VS Code's IntelliSense to show variable suggestions and types

### 3. Data Types (25 minutes)
- Introduce the concept of data types
- Cover three basic data types:
  1. Integers (whole numbers)
  2. Floats (decimal numbers)
  3. Strings (text)
- Demonstrate how to check the type of a variable using `type()`
- Show type conversion (e.g., `int()`, `float()`, `str()`)
- Use VS Code's hover feature to display variable types

### 4. Basic Arithmetic Operations (20 minutes)
- Demonstrate arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, // (integer division), % (modulo), ** (exponentiation)
- Show how these work with integers and floats
- Introduce the concept of operator precedence
- Demonstrate using parentheses to control order of operations
- Use VS Code's integrated terminal to quickly test arithmetic operations

### 5. Hands-on Practice (15 minutes)
- Guide students through creating a simple program that:
  1. Asks for user input (their name and age)
  2. Stores these in variables
  3. Performs a calculation (e.g., calculates the year they'll turn 100)
  4. Prints out a message using these variables
- Demonstrate how to run and debug the program in VS Code

### 6. Introduction to the Calculator Project (10 minutes)
- Introduce the homework assignment: creating a simple calculator
- Brainstorm with the class what operations the calculator should perform
- Discuss how variables and user input can be used in this project
- Show how to create a new Python file in VS Code for the project

### 7. Wrap-up and Q&A (10 minutes)
- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Answer any remaining questions
- Preview the next lesson's topic
- Remind students how to save their work in VS Code and push to version control if applicable

## Additional Resources
- Python's official documentation on numeric types: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex
- VS Code Python debugging: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Confusion between integers and floats: Use VS Code's variable hovering to show type information
- String concatenation errors: Demonstrate VS Code's error highlighting for type mismatches
- Variable name errors: Show how VS Code's IntelliSense can help with naming conventions

## Extension Activities
For students who finish early or want extra challenges:
- Create a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius
- Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle based on user input
- Experiment with more complex mathematical operations using the `math` module, demonstrating VS Code's auto-import feature

Remember to encourage experimentation and emphasize that making mistakes is part of the learning process. Provide plenty of opportunities for students to ask questions and share their discoveries with the class.
