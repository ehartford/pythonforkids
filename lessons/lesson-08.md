# Lesson 8: Built-in Functions and Importing Modules

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Understand and use common built-in functions in Python
2. Import and use functions from the math and random modules
3. Understand the concept of modules and their benefits
4. Create a program that utilizes both built-in functions and imported module functions

## Materials Needed
- Computers with Python and IDLE installed
- Projector or screen sharing capability
- Prepared code examples

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Review (10 minutes)
- Recap the previous lesson on defining and calling functions
- Address any questions from the homework (3D shape volume calculator)
- Quick quiz on function basics

### 2. Common Built-in Functions (20 minutes)
- Introduce and demonstrate common built-in functions:
  - len(), max(), min(), sum()
  - abs(), round()
  - type(), isinstance()
- Show how to use the help() function to learn about other functions
- Guide students through using these functions in simple programs

### 3. Introduction to Modules (15 minutes)
- Explain what modules are and why they're useful
- Discuss the concept of code organization and reusability
- Introduce the syntax for importing modules
- Briefly mention the Python Standard Library

### 4. The Math Module (20 minutes)
- Demonstrate how to import the math module
- Show commonly used functions from the math module:
  - math.sqrt(), math.pi, math.ceil(), math.floor()
- Guide students through creating a program that uses math module functions

### 5. The Random Module (20 minutes)
- Introduce the random module and its uses
- Demonstrate key functions:
  - random.randint(), random.choice(), random.shuffle()
- Show how to set a random seed for reproducibility
- Guide students in creating a simple game using the random module

### 6. Hands-on Practice: Dice Rolling Program (15 minutes)
- Guide students in creating a dice rolling program that:
  1. Asks the user how many dice to roll
  2. Asks how many sides each die has
  3. Uses the random module to simulate dice rolls
  4. Calculates and displays the sum and average of the rolls

### 7. Wrap-up and Homework Introduction (10 minutes)
- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Introduce the homework assignment: Create a math quiz program that generates random questions and checks answers
- Preview the next lesson's topic (creating custom modules)

## Additional Resources
- "Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 7 - Recycling Your Code with Functions and Modules (second half)
- Python's official documentation on the math module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html
- Python's official documentation on the random module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Forgetting to import modules before using them: Emphasize the importance of import statements
- Confusion about module function syntax: Clarify the dot notation used with imported modules
- Misunderstanding randomness: Explain that computer-generated randomness is pseudo-random

## Extension Activities
For students who finish early or want extra challenges:
- Create a program that simulates coin flips and calculates probabilities
- Implement a simple encryption program using the random module to generate keys
- Write a program that uses the math module to solve quadratic equations

Encourage students to explore the Python Standard Library and discover other useful modules. Discuss how modules can be used to extend Python's capabilities and make programming more efficient.
