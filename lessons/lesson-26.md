1. Create a new CSS file and link it to their HTML
2. Apply styles to improve the overall layout
3. Style text elements (headings, paragraphs)
4. Implement a simple responsive design
5. Use the Live Server extension to preview changes in real-time

### 6. Wrap-up and Homework Introduction (10 minutes)

## Additional Resources
- VS Code CSS Programming: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/css
- MDN CSS Basics: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Selector specificity conflicts: Explain the order of precedence in CSS
- Box model confusion: Provide visual aids to explain margin, padding, and border
- Responsive design challenges: Encourage testing with different viewport sizes

## Extension Activities
For students who finish early or want extra challenges:
- Implement a CSS grid layout
- Experiment with CSS custom properties (variables)
- Create a simple CSS animation

Encourage students to use browser developer tools alongside VS Code to inspect and modify CSS in real-time. Demonstrate how this can speed up the design process and help understand how styles are applied to elements.
