# Lesson 36: Final Project - Presentations and Course Wrap-up

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Present their final projects effectively
2. Demonstrate the key features and functionality of their projects
3. Reflect on their learning journey throughout the course
4. Provide and receive constructive feedback on projects
5. Understand next steps for continuing their programming journey

## Materials Needed
- Computers with students' final projects and Visual Studio Code installed
- Projector or large screen for presentations
- Feedback forms (digital or physical)
- Course completion certificates (if applicable)
- List of resources for further learning

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Preparation for Presentations (15 minutes)
- Guide students in making last-minute preparations
- Demonstrate how to use VS Code's Zen Mode for distraction-free final touches
- Encourage students to do a quick run-through of their presentation

### 2. Project Presentations (90 minutes, time may vary based on class size)
- Each student presents their project (5-7 minutes each)
- Demonstrate key features and functionality
- Explain challenges faced and solutions implemented
- Use VS Code's presentation mode or Live Share for code demonstrations
- Allow brief Q&A after each presentation

### 3. Peer Feedback Session (20 minutes)
- Students provide written feedback on their peers' projects
- Encourage constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement
- Use VS Code's Live Share for collaborative code review if time allows

### 4. Course Reflection (15 minutes)
- Lead a discussion on the key learnings from the course
- Have students share their most significant achievements or challenges
- Discuss how the skills learned apply to real-world programming

### 5. Introduction to Further Learning Paths (15 minutes)
- Present options for continuing to learn programming
- Introduce advanced topics in web development, game development, or general Python
- Showcase relevant VS Code extensions for different programming paths
- Provide a list of resources (online courses, books, coding challenges)

### 6. Course Wrap-up and Certificates (15 minutes)
- Summarize the course journey
- Highlight key milestones and achievements
- Distribute course completion certificates (if applicable)
- Share any final thoughts or advice for budding programmers

## Additional Resources
- Python Learning Resources: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers
- VS Code for Python Developers: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python

## Presentation Tips
- Encourage students to start with a brief overview of their project
- Advise them to focus on unique or challenging aspects of their implementation
- Suggest demonstrating live code execution rather than just showing static code
- Remind them to be prepared for technical issues and have backups

## Extension Activities
- Create a class GitHub repository with links to all student projects
- Establish a communication channel for the class to stay in touch and share future learning experiences
- Encourage students to continue developing their projects and share updates

Conclude by showing students how to use VS Code's "Settings Sync" feature to back up their VS Code settings and extensions. This will help them maintain their personalized development environment as they continue their programming journey.
