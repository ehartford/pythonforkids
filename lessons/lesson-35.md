# Lesson 35: Final Project - Implementation

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Implement core features of their final project
2. Apply debugging techniques to solve implementation challenges
3. Use VS Code effectively for coding, testing, and debugging
4. Collaborate with peers and seek help when needed
5. Demonstrate progress on their project

## Materials Needed
- Computers with necessary software (Python, Flask/Pygame, VS Code) installed
- Students' project plans and design documents from previous lesson
- Debugging cheat sheet
- Projector or screen sharing capability

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Review and Goal Setting (15 minutes)
- Briefly review project plans and design documents
- Have students set specific implementation goals for the session
- Demonstrate using VS Code's todo comments to mark areas for implementation

### 2. Coding Session - Part 1 (40 minutes)
- Students work on implementing core features of their projects
- Encourage use of VS Code's IntelliSense and documentation features
- Provide individual assistance as needed
- Use VS Code's Live Share for collaborative problem-solving

### 3. Debugging Techniques (20 minutes)
- Discuss common debugging strategies
- Demonstrate using VS Code's debugging tools effectively
- Show how to use breakpoints, watch variables, and step through code
- Guide students in applying these techniques to their own projects

### 4. Coding Session - Part 2 (40 minutes)
- Students continue working on their projects, applying debugging techniques
- Encourage peer collaboration and problem-solving
- Provide guidance on project-specific challenges
- Use VS Code's source control features to commit progress regularly

### 5. Progress Check and Peer Review (25 minutes)
- Have students briefly present their progress to a peer
- Encourage constructive feedback and suggestions
- Use VS Code's Live Share feature for peer code review
- Guide students in documenting feedback and planning next steps

### 6. Wrap-up and Next Steps (10 minutes)
- Recap the main challenges and solutions from the session
- Discuss common issues faced and how they were resolved
- Preview the final lesson's focus on project completion and presentation
- Encourage students to continue working on their projects outside of class

## Additional Resources
- VS Code Debugging: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging
- Python Debugging in VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Feature creep: Remind students to focus on core functionality first
- Integration issues: Guide students in breaking down problems into smaller, manageable parts
- Performance problems: Discuss basic optimization techniques relevant to their projects

## Extension Activities
- Implement unit tests for project components
- Explore advanced VS Code extensions relevant to their project type
- Begin preparing documentation or user guides for their projects

Encourage students to use VS Code's "Git Graph" extension to visualize their project's development history. Demonstrate how this can help in understanding the project's evolution and managing different features or experiments.
