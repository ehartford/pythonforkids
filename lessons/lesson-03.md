# Lesson 3: Input and Output

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Use the `input()` function to get user input
2. Understand and use string formatting techniques
3. Create interactive programs that take user input and produce formatted output
4. Use VS Code effectively for writing and testing interactive Python programs

## Materials Needed
- Computers with Python and Visual Studio Code installed
- Projector or screen sharing capability
- Prepared code examples

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Review (10 minutes)
- Recap the previous lesson on variables and data types
- Address any questions from the homework (simple calculator program)
- Quick quiz on variables and data types using VS Code's Live Share for collaborative coding

### 2. Introduction to User Input (20 minutes)
- Explain the importance of getting input from users
- Introduce the `input()` function
- Demonstrate how to use `input()` and store the result in a variable
- Explain that `input()` always returns a string
- Show how to convert input to other data types (int, float)
- Use VS Code's integrated terminal to test input functions interactively

### 3. String Formatting Basics (25 minutes)
- Review string concatenation
- Introduce f-strings (formatted string literals)
- Demonstrate using variables inside f-strings
- Show how to format numbers (decimal places, padding)
- Briefly mention older formatting methods (.format() and %)
- Use VS Code's IntelliSense to explore string methods

### 4. Creating Interactive Programs (20 minutes)
- Demonstrate combining input and output to create interactive programs
- Walk through creating a program that:
  1. Asks for the user's name and age
  2. Calculates the year they'll turn 100
  3. Prints a formatted message with this information
- Show how to run and debug the program in VS Code

### 5. Hands-on Practice (15 minutes)
- Guide students in creating a "Mad Libs" style program that:
  1. Asks the user for various words (nouns, verbs, adjectives)
  2. Inserts these words into a pre-written story
  3. Prints out the complete story with the user's words
- Encourage students to use VS Code's multi-cursor editing for efficient coding

### 6. Advanced Output Formatting (10 minutes)
- Show how to print multiple lines using triple quotes
- Demonstrate using escape characters (\n, \t)
- Briefly introduce the `print()` function's parameters (sep, end)
- Use VS Code's code folding feature to manage longer strings

### 7. Wrap-up and Homework Introduction (10 minutes)
- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Introduce the homework assignment: Create a program that asks for the user's name and age, then prints a personalized greeting with some calculations (e.g., days lived, heartbeats)
- Preview the next lesson's topic
- Show how to use VS Code's source control features to commit their work

## Additional Resources
- Python's official documentation on input and output: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html
- VS Code Python formatting: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_formatting

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Forgetting to convert input to the correct data type: Use VS Code's type checking and linting
- Syntax errors in f-strings: Show how VS Code highlights syntax errors in real-time
- Confusion about string vs. numeric operations: Demonstrate using VS Code's debugger to inspect variable types

## Extension Activities
For students who finish early or want extra challenges:
- Create a simple quiz program that asks questions and keeps score
- Write a program that generates "ASCII art" based on user input
- Experiment with more advanced string formatting (alignment, padding, etc.)

Remember to encourage creativity and problem-solving. Allow students to share their programs with the class, fostering a collaborative learning environment. Be prepared to help troubleshoot common errors and guide students towards finding solutions on their own using VS Code's features.
