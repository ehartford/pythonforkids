# Lesson 10: Introduction to Lists

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Understand what lists are and why they're useful
2. Create and initialize lists in Python
3. Access and modify list elements
4. Perform basic list operations (append, extend, insert)
5. Create a simple to-do list program using Visual Studio Code

## Materials Needed
- Computers with Python and Visual Studio Code installed
- Projector or screen sharing capability
- Prepared code examples

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Review and Introduction to Visual Studio Code (15 minutes)
- Recap the previous lesson on custom modules
- Introduce Visual Studio Code as the new development environment
- Show how to create a new Python file in VS Code
- Demonstrate basic features: code editor, integrated terminal, running Python scripts

### 2. Introduction to Lists (20 minutes)
- Explain what lists are and why they're useful
- Show how to create lists in Python
- Demonstrate different ways to initialize lists
- Explain list indexing and how to access list elements

### 3. Modifying Lists (20 minutes)
- Show how to modify list elements
- Demonstrate slicing lists
- Introduce basic list methods: append(), extend(), insert()
- Guide students through examples using these methods

### 4. List Operations in VS Code (15 minutes)
- Demonstrate using VS Code's integrated terminal to interact with lists
- Show how to use VS Code's debugging features with lists
- Introduce VS Code extensions useful for Python development (e.g., Python extension)

### 5. Hands-on Practice: To-Do List Program (30 minutes)
- Guide students in creating a simple to-do list program in VS Code:
  1. Create a new Python file for the program
  2. Implement functions to add items to the list
  3. Create a function to display the current list
  4. Implement a function to mark items as completed (remove from list)
  5. Use VS Code's integrated terminal to test the program

### 6. Wrap-up and Homework Introduction (10 minutes)
- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Introduce the homework assignment: Enhance the to-do list program with additional features (e.g., priority levels, due dates)
- Preview the next lesson's topic (list operations and methods)

## Additional Resources
- Visual Studio Code Python Tutorial: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial
- Python's official documentation on lists: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists

## Common Issues and Solutions
- VS Code setup issues: Prepare a troubleshooting guide for common setup problems
- List index out of range errors: Explain zero-based indexing and list length
- Confusion between append() and extend(): Clarify the difference with examples

## Extension Activities
For students who finish early or want extra challenges:
- Implement a feature to save and load the to-do list from a file
- Create a program that manages a playlist of songs using lists
- Experiment with nested lists to create a simple 2D game board

Remember to emphasize the benefits of using VS Code, such as IntelliSense for code completion and easy debugging. Encourage students to explore VS Code features as they work on their projects.
