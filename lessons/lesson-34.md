## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Understand the components of a good project plan
2. Develop a project proposal for their final project
3. Create a basic design document outlining their project's features and structure
4. Set up a project structure in VS Code
5. Begin implementing the core structure of their project

## Materials Needed
- Computers with necessary software (Python, Flask/Pygame, VS Code) installed

- Discuss setting realistic goals and scope for the project
- Have students start drafting their project proposals in VS Code

### 3. Creating Design Documents (30 minutes)
- Explain the purpose and structure of a design document
- Show how to outline features and functionality
- Demonstrate creating basic wireframes or mockups
- Guide students in starting their design documents
- Use VS Code's "Draw.io Integration" extension for simple diagramming

### 4. Project Structure Setup (20 minutes)

- Demonstrate making initial commits and creating branches
- Guide students in setting up version control for their projects

### 6. Hands-on Project Work (35 minutes)
- Have students begin implementing the core structure of their projects
- Encourage them to set up basic files and any necessary dependencies
- Provide individual guidance and answer questions
- Use VS Code's Live Share feature for collaborative problem-solving

### 7. Wrap-up and Next Steps (10 minutes)
- Recap the importance of planning and design
- Discuss the next steps in project development

- VS Code Git Integration: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Scope creep: Emphasize the importance of setting realistic goals
- Lack of detail in design documents: Encourage thorough planning to avoid future roadblocks
- Git conflicts: Demonstrate how to resolve basic merge conflicts in VS Code

## Extension Activities
- Create a project timeline or Gantt chart using VS Code extensions
- Develop user stories for the project features
- Set up a project board in GitHub or Trello to track tasks

Encourage students to use VS Code's task management features to create a list of todos for their project. Demonstrate how this can help in organizing their development process and tracking progress.
