# Lesson 25: HTML Basics

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Understand the structure and purpose of HTML
2. Create a basic HTML document
3. Use common HTML tags (headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists)
4. Implement HTML forms with various input types
5. Validate HTML using VS Code extensions
6. Create a simple personal webpage using HTML

## Materials Needed
- Computers with Visual Studio Code installed
- Live Server extension for VS Code
- HTML Validator extension for VS Code
- Projector or screen sharing capability
- Prepared HTML examples

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Introduction to HTML (15 minutes)
- Explain what HTML is and its role in web development
- Discuss the concept of markup languages
- Show the basic structure of an HTML document
- Use VS Code to create a new HTML file and demonstrate the `!` shortcut for boilerplate

### 2. Common HTML Tags (30 minutes)
- Introduce and demonstrate usage of:
  - Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
  - Paragraphs (`<p>`)
  - Links (`<a>`)
  - Images (`<img>`)
  - Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
- Show how to use attributes in HTML tags
- Use VS Code's Emmet abbreviations to quickly generate HTML structures

### 3. HTML Forms (25 minutes)
- Explain the purpose of HTML forms
- Demonstrate creating a basic form structure
- Show different input types (text, password, radio, checkbox, etc.)
- Introduce form submission and the action attribute
- Use VS Code's IntelliSense to explore form-related tags and attributes

### 4. HTML Validation and Best Practices (20 minutes)
- Discuss the importance of valid HTML
- Demonstrate using the HTML Validator extension in VS Code
- Explain common HTML best practices (semantic markup, accessibility)
- Show how to use VS Code's built-in HTML formatting

### 5. Hands-on Practice: Creating a Personal Webpage (30 minutes)
Guide students in creating a simple personal webpage:
1. Create a new HTML file in VS Code
2. Implement a structure with:
   - A header with their name
   - A short bio about themselves
   - A list of their hobbies
   - An image (it can be a placeholder)
   - A simple contact form
3. Use the Live Server extension to preview the page in real-time
4. Validate the HTML and fix any errors

### 6. Wrap-up and Homework Introduction (10 minutes)
- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Introduce the homework assignment: Enhance the personal webpage (e.g., add more sections, experiment with different HTML tags)
- Preview the next lesson's topic (CSS basics)

## Additional Resources
- VS Code HTML Programming: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html
- MDN HTML Basics: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Forgetting to close tags: Encourage using VS Code's auto-closing feature
- Incorrect nesting of elements: Demonstrate proper nesting and indentation
- Misuse of semantic tags: Explain the importance of using the right tag for the right purpose

## Extension Activities
For students who finish early or want extra challenges:
- Experiment with semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, article, etc.)
- Create a multi-page website with internal links
- Implement a more complex form with various input types and basic client-side validation

Encourage students to use the W3C HTML Validator (https://validator.w3.org/) in addition to VS Code's validator to ensure their HTML is standards-compliant. Demonstrate how this can help catch errors that might not be apparent visually.
