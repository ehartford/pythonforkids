# Lesson 6: For Loops

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Understand the concept and syntax of for loops
2. Use the range() function with for loops
3. Iterate over sequences (like strings or lists) using for loops
4. Implement nested loops
5. Create a program that prints multiplication tables using nested for loops in VS Code

## Materials Needed
- Computers with Python and Visual Studio Code installed
- Python extension for VS Code
- Projector or screen sharing capability
- Prepared code examples

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Review (10 minutes)
- Recap the previous lesson on while loops
- Address any questions from the homework (menu-driven program)
- Quick quiz on while loops and their applications using VS Code's Live Share feature

### 2. Introduction to For Loops (15 minutes)
- Explain the concept of for loops and how they differ from while loops
- Discuss scenarios where for loops are preferable
- Introduce the basic syntax of a for loop
- Demonstrate creating a new Python file in VS Code for for loop examples

### 3. The range() Function (20 minutes)
- Introduce the range() function and its parameters (start, stop, step)
- Demonstrate using range() with for loops
- Show how to create loops that count up, down, or skip numbers
- Guide students through creating simple programs using for loops and range()
- Use VS Code's IntelliSense to explore range() function parameters

### 4. Iterating Over Sequences (20 minutes)
- Explain how for loops can iterate over sequences like strings and lists
- Demonstrate iterating over a string to process each character
- Introduce the concept of lists (briefly, as preparation for future lessons)
- Show how to iterate over a list using a for loop
- Use VS Code's debugger to step through iterations and inspect loop variables

### 5. Nested Loops (20 minutes)
- Introduce the concept of nested loops
- Demonstrate creating and using nested for loops
- Discuss real-world scenarios where nested loops are useful
- Show how to print simple patterns using nested loops
- Use VS Code's code folding feature to manage nested loop structures

### 6. Hands-on Practice: Multiplication Tables (15 minutes)
- Guide students in creating a program that prints multiplication tables:
  1. Ask the user for a number n
  2. Use nested for loops to print the multiplication tables for numbers 1 to n
  3. Format the output to align the numbers properly
- Demonstrate using VS Code's integrated terminal to run and test the program

### 7. Wrap-up and Homework Introduction (10 minutes)
- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Introduce the homework assignment: Create a program that uses nested loops to draw a simple shape (like a triangle or square) using asterisks
- Preview the next week's topics (functions and modules)
- Show how to use VS Code's source control features to commit their work

## Additional Resources
- Python's official documentation on for statements: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements
- VS Code Python linting: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Confusion between range() parameters: Use VS Code's hover feature to show parameter hints
- Infinite loops in nested structures: Demonstrate using VS Code's debugger to identify loop issues
- Off-by-one errors: Show how to use VS Code's breakpoints to check loop boundaries

## Extension Activities
For students who finish early or want extra challenges:
- Create a program that generates a simple bar chart using nested loops and user input
- Implement a basic encryption/decryption program using Caesar cipher with for loops
- Write a program that finds prime numbers up to a given limit using nested loops

Encourage students to experiment with different loop structures and to think about how they can use loops to solve more complex problems. Facilitate discussions about code efficiency and readability when using loops. Use VS Code's comment feature to add explanatory notes in code examples.
