# Week 4: Lists and Tuples

Welcome to Week 4 of Uncle Eric's Python course! This week, you'll learn about lists and tuples, which are powerful data structures for storing and manipulating collections of items.

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Lists

### Topics
- What are lists?
- Creating lists
- Accessing elements in a list
- Basic list operations (append, extend, insert)

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 3 - Strings, Lists, Tuples, and Maps (Lists section)

### Homework
Create a simple to-do list program. Your program should:
1. Allow the user to add items to the list
2. Display the current list
3. Allow the user to mark items as completed (remove them from the list)
* Due: Before Lesson 2

## Lesson 2: List Operations and Methods

### Topics
- List slicing
- List methods (remove, pop, index, count)
- Sorting lists
- List comprehensions (introduction)

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 3 - Strings, Lists, Tuples, and Maps (Lists section, continued)

### Homework
Create a program to manage a playlist of songs. The program should:
1. Allow the user to add songs to the playlist
2. Allow the user to remove songs from the playlist
3. Display the playlist
4. Shuffle the playlist (Hint: use the random module)
* Due: Before Lesson 3

## Lesson 3: Tuples and Their Uses

### Topics
- What are tuples?
- Creating tuples
- Accessing elements in a tuple
- Differences between lists and tuples
- When to use tuples vs lists

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 3 - Strings, Lists, Tuples, and Maps (Tuples section)

### Homework
Create a program to store and display information about books using tuples. The program should:
1. Create a list of book tuples (each tuple containing title, author, and year of publication)
2. Allow the user to add new books
3. Display all books
4. Allow the user to search for books by author
* Due: Before next week's Lesson 1

## Additional Notes
- Remember to bring your laptop to each class with Python installed.
- Don't hesitate to ask Uncle Eric questions during the lessons or via email if you need help.
- Practice coding a little bit each day to reinforce what you've learned.
- Have fun and be creative with your homework assignments!

## Looking Ahead
Next week, we'll explore dictionaries and sets. These data structures will give you even more ways to organize and manipulate data in your programs. Get ready to add more tools to your Python toolkit!
