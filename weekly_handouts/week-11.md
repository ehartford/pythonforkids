# Week 11: Game Development with Pygame

Welcome to Week 11 of Uncle Eric's Python course! This week, we'll explore game development using Pygame, a popular library for creating 2D games in Python.

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Pygame

### Topics
- Installing Pygame
- Setting up a game window
- Game loops
- Drawing shapes and colors

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 13 - How to Make Games with Pygame

### Homework
Create a simple drawing program:
1. Set up a Pygame window
2. Allow the user to draw by clicking and dragging the mouse
3. Implement different colors that can be selected
4. Add a clear screen button
* Due: Before Lesson 2

## Lesson 2: Sprite and Event Handling

### Topics
- Creating and using sprites
- Handling keyboard and mouse events
- Moving sprites on the screen
- Collision detection

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 14 - Bounce!

### Homework
Create a simple paddle game:
1. Create a paddle that the player can move left and right
2. Add a ball that bounces around the screen
3. Implement collision detection between the ball and paddle
4. Keep score based on how many times the player hits the ball
* Due: Before Lesson 3

## Lesson 3: Sound and Text in Pygame

### Topics
- Adding background music and sound effects
- Rendering text on the screen
- Creating a game menu
- Implementing a game over screen

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 15 - Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit

### Homework
Enhance your paddle game:
1. Add background music and sound effects for collisions
2. Create a start menu with "Play" and "Quit" options
3. Add a game over screen that shows the player's score
4. Implement levels that increase in difficulty
* Due: Before next week's Lesson 1

## Additional Notes
- Make sure you have Pygame installed on your computer.
- Don't hesitate to ask Uncle Eric questions during the lessons or via email if you need help.
- Game development is a great way to apply many of the programming concepts you've learned so far. Have fun with it!

## Looking Ahead
Next week is our final week! We'll work on your final projects, applying everything you've learned throughout the course. Get ready to showcase your Python skills!
