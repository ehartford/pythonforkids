# Week 2: Control Structures

Welcome to Week 2 of Uncle Eric's Python course! This week, you'll learn about control structures, which are fundamental tools for making decisions in your programs and repeating actions.

## Lesson 1: If Statements

### Topics
- Boolean expressions
- Simple if statements
- if-else statements
- elif (else if) statements

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 4 - Drawing with Turtles (focus on the sections about if statements)

### Homework
Create a simple guessing game using if statements. The program should:
1. Choose a random number between 1 and 10
2. Ask the user to guess the number
3. Tell the user if their guess is too high, too low, or correct
* Due: Before Lesson 2

## Lesson 2: While Loops

### Topics
- What are loops and why are they useful?
- While loop syntax
- Using while loops for repetitive tasks
- break and continue statements

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 5 - Asking Questions with if and else (section on while loops)

### Homework
Create a countdown program using a while loop. The program should:
1. Ask the user for a starting number
2. Count down from that number to 1, printing each number
3. Print "Blastoff!" when it reaches 0
* Due: Before Lesson 3

## Lesson 3: For Loops

### Topics
- For loop syntax
- Using for loops with range() function
- Iterating over sequences (like strings or lists)
- Nested loops

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 6 - Going Loopy

### Homework
Create a program that prints multiplication tables using nested for loops. The program should:
1. Ask the user for a number n
2. Print the multiplication tables for numbers 1 to n
* Due: Before next week's Lesson 1

## Additional Notes
- Bring your laptop with Python installed to each class
- Ask Uncle Eric if you need help during lessons or via email
- Practice a little bit every day
- Be creative and have fun with your homework!

## Looking Ahead
Next week, we'll introduce you to functions and modules. These tools will help you organize your code and make it reusable. Get ready to level up your Python skills!
