# Week 5: Dictionaries and Sets

Welcome to Week 5 of Uncle Eric's Python course! This week, you'll learn about dictionaries and sets, which are versatile data structures for storing and manipulating collections of data.

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Dictionaries

### Topics
- What are dictionaries?
- Creating dictionaries
- Accessing and modifying key-value pairs
- Dictionary methods (keys, values, items)

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 3 - Strings, Lists, Tuples, and Maps (Maps section)

### Homework
Create a simple address book using dictionaries. Your program should:
1. Allow the user to add new contacts (name as key, phone number as value)
2. Display all contacts
3. Allow the user to search for a contact by name
* Due: Before Lesson 2

## Lesson 2: Dictionary Operations and Nested Structures

### Topics
- Looping through dictionaries
- Dictionary comprehensions (introduction)
- Nested dictionaries
- Using dictionaries with lists and tuples

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 3 - Strings, Lists, Tuples, and Maps (Maps section, continued)

### Homework
Create a program to manage a small library catalog. The program should:
1. Use a dictionary where book titles are keys and values are nested dictionaries containing author, year, and genre
2. Allow the user to add new books
3. Allow the user to search for books by title, author, or genre
4. Display all books in a formatted way
* Due: Before Lesson 3

## Lesson 3: Sets and Their Operations

### Topics
- What are sets?
- Creating sets
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- When to use sets

### Textbook Reference
"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, Chapter 6 - Dictionaries (section on Sets)

### Homework
Create a program to analyze text using sets. The program should:
1. Ask the user to input a paragraph of text
2. Display the number of unique words in the text
3. Allow the user to input two paragraphs and display words that appear in both (intersection)
4. Display words that appear in the first paragraph but not the second (difference)
* Due: Before next week's Lesson 1

## Additional Notes
- Remember to bring your laptop to each class with Python installed.
- Don't hesitate to ask Uncle Eric questions during the lessons or via email if you need help.
- Practice coding a little bit each day to reinforce what you've learned.
- Have fun and be creative with your homework assignments!

## Looking Ahead
Next week, we'll learn about file handling and exception handling. These skills will allow you to work with external data and make your programs more robust. Get ready to take your Python skills to the next level!
