# Week 10: Web Development with Flask

Welcome to Week 10 of Uncle Eric's Python course! This week, we'll dive deeper into web development with Flask, learning about templates, forms, and databases.

## Lesson 1: Flask Templates

### Topics
- Jinja2 templating language
- Creating and rendering templates
- Template inheritance
- Passing data to templates

### Textbook Reference
No direct coverage in the textbooks; Uncle Eric will provide supplementary materials

### Homework
Enhance your Flask application from last week:
1. Create a base template with a common layout (header, footer, navigation)
2. Create child templates for your home and about pages
3. Pass some dynamic data (e.g., current date, user name) to your templates
* Due: Before Lesson 2

## Lesson 2: Flask Forms

### Topics
- Creating and handling forms in Flask
- Flask-WTF extension
- Form validation
- Displaying form errors

### Textbook Reference
No direct coverage in the textbooks; Uncle Eric will provide supplementary materials

### Homework
Add a contact form to your Flask application:
1. Create a new route and template for a contact page
2. Implement a contact form using Flask-WTF
3. Add form validation (e.g., required fields, email format)
4. Display a success message when the form is submitted correctly
* Due: Before Lesson 3

## Lesson 3: Flask and Databases (SQLite)

### Topics
- Introduction to databases
- Setting up SQLite with Flask
- Creating database models
- Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

### Textbook Reference
"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, Chapter 11 - Testing Your Code (for SQLite basics)

### Homework
Create a simple todo list application:
1. Set up a SQLite database to store tasks
2. Create routes to add, view, update, and delete tasks
3. Implement a page to display all tasks
4. Add functionality to mark tasks as complete
* Due: Before next week's Lesson 1

## Additional Notes
- Make sure you have Flask and Flask-WTF installed on your computer.
- Don't hesitate to ask Uncle Eric questions during the lessons or via email if you need help.
- Web development can be challenging, but it's also very rewarding. Keep practicing!

## Looking Ahead
Next week, we'll switch gears and explore game development with Pygame. Get ready to bring your Python skills to life in a whole new way!
