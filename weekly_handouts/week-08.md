# Week 8: Intermediate Python Concepts

Welcome to Week 8 of Uncle Eric's Python course! This week, we'll dive into some more advanced Python concepts that will help you write more efficient and powerful code.

## Lesson 1: List Comprehensions

### Topics
- Understanding list comprehensions
- Basic syntax of list comprehensions
- Conditional list comprehensions
- Nested list comprehensions

### Textbook Reference
"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, Chapter 4 - Working with Lists (section on List Comprehensions)

### Homework
Create a program that uses list comprehensions to:
1. Generate a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 20
2. Create a list of even numbers from a given list of integers
3. Convert a list of Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit
* Due: Before Lesson 2

## Lesson 2: Lambda Functions and Map/Filter

### Topics
- Lambda functions: creating small anonymous functions
- The map() function: applying a function to an iterable
- The filter() function: filtering elements based on a condition
- Combining lambda with map and filter

### Textbook Reference
"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, Chapter 9 - Classes (brief mention of lambda functions)

### Homework
Create a program that uses lambda functions, map(), and filter() to:
1. Convert a list of names to uppercase using map()
2. Filter out words shorter than 4 letters from a list using filter()
3. Sort a list of tuples based on the second element using a lambda function
* Due: Before Lesson 3

## Lesson 3: Regular Expressions

### Topics
- Introduction to regular expressions
- Basic pattern matching
- Special characters and character classes
- Using the re module in Python

### Textbook Reference
No direct coverage in the textbooks; Uncle Eric will provide supplementary materials

### Homework
Create a program that uses regular expressions to:
1. Validate email addresses
2. Extract all phone numbers from a given text
3. Replace all occurrences of dates in MM-DD-YYYY format with DD-MM-YYYY format in a text
* Due: Before next week's Lesson 1

## Additional Notes
- Remember to bring your laptop to each class with Python installed.
- Don't hesitate to ask Uncle Eric questions during the lessons or via email if you need help.
- These concepts might seem tricky at first, but they're very powerful once you get the hang of them!
- Try to think of real-world scenarios where these concepts could be useful.

## Looking Ahead
Next week, we'll start our journey into web development! We'll learn the basics of HTML and CSS, and then move on to creating simple web applications with Flask. Get ready to see your Python code come to life on the web!
