# Week 3: Functions and Modules

Welcome to Week 3 of Uncle Eric's Python course! This week, you'll learn about functions and modules, which are essential tools for organizing your code and making it more reusable.

## Lesson 1: Defining and Calling Functions

### Topics
- What are functions and why are they useful?
- Function syntax
- Parameters and arguments
- Return values

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 7 - Recycling Your Code with Functions and Modules (first half)

### Homework
Create a function to calculate the area of different shapes (circle, square, triangle). Your program should:
1. Define functions for each shape's area calculation
2. Ask the user which shape they want to calculate
3. Get necessary measurements from the user
4. Call the appropriate function and display the result
* Due: Before Lesson 2

## Lesson 2: Built-in Functions and Importing Modules

### Topics
- Common built-in functions (len(), max(), min(), etc.)
- What are modules?
- Importing modules (e.g., math, random)
- Using functions from imported modules

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 7 - Recycling Your Code with Functions and Modules (second half)

### Homework
Create a dice rolling program using the random module. The program should:
1. Ask the user how many dice to roll
2. Ask how many sides each die has
3. Roll the dice and display the results
* Due: Before Lesson 3

## Lesson 3: Creating Custom Modules

### Topics
- Writing your own modules
- Importing your custom modules
- Organizing code with modules

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 7 - Recycling Your Code with Functions and Modules (review and expand)

### Homework
Create a module with utility functions and use it in a main program:
1. Create a module with at least 3 useful functions (e.g., temperature conversion, basic math operations)
2. Create a main program that imports your module
3. Use the functions from your module in the main program
* Due: Before next week's Lesson 1

## Additional Notes
- Remember to bring your laptop to each class with Python installed.
- Don't hesitate to ask Uncle Eric questions during the lessons or via email if you need help.
- Practice coding a little bit each day to reinforce what you've learned.
- Have fun and be creative with your homework assignments!

## Looking Ahead
Next week, we'll dive into more complex data structures: lists and tuples. These will allow you to work with collections of data in your programs. Get ready to handle more information in your Python code!
