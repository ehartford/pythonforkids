# Week 6: File Handling and Exception Handling

Welcome to Week 6 of Uncle Eric's Python course! This week, you'll learn how to work with files and handle exceptions, making your programs more versatile and robust.

## Lesson 1: Reading and Writing Text Files

### Topics
- Opening and closing files
- Reading from files (read(), readline(), readlines())
- Writing to files (write(), writelines())
- The 'with' statement for file handling

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 10 - Saving and Loading Files (first part)
"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, Chapter 10 - Files and Exceptions (for additional exercises)

### Homework
Create a program that reads a text file and counts the occurrences of each word. The program should:
1. Read a text file (you can create a sample file)
2. Count how many times each word appears
3. Write the results to a new file in a formatted way
* Due: Before Lesson 2

## Lesson 2: Working with CSV Files

### Topics
- What are CSV files?
- Reading CSV files
- Writing CSV files
- Using the csv module

### Textbook Reference
"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, Chapter 16 - Downloading Data (section on CSV files)

### Homework
Create a program to manage student grades using CSV files. The program should:
1. Read a CSV file containing student names and their grades for different subjects
2. Calculate the average grade for each student
3. Allow the user to add new student data
4. Write the updated data (including averages) back to the CSV file
* Due: Before Lesson 3

## Lesson 3: Exception Handling

### Topics
- What are exceptions?
- Try-except blocks
- Handling specific exceptions
- The finally clause
- Raising exceptions

### Textbook Reference
"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, Chapter 10 - Files and Exceptions (section on Exceptions)

### Homework
Modify your previous programs (word counter and grade manager) to include proper exception handling. Your programs should:
1. Handle file not found errors
2. Handle permission errors when writing files
3. Use appropriate exception handling for user inputs
4. Implement at least one custom exception
* Due: Before next week's Lesson 1

## Additional Notes
- Remember to bring your laptop to each class with Python installed.
- Don't hesitate to ask Uncle Eric questions during the lessons or via email if you need help.
- Practice coding a little bit each day to reinforce what you've learned.
- Have fun and be creative with your homework assignments!

## Looking Ahead
Next week, we'll dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) basics. You'll learn how to create your own classes and objects, opening up a whole new way of structuring your programs. Get ready to think about programming in a new and powerful way!
