# Week 9: Introduction to Web Development

Welcome to Week 9 of Uncle Eric's Python course! This week, we'll begin our exploration of web development, starting with the basics of HTML and CSS, and then moving on to creating simple web applications with Flask.

## Lesson 1: HTML Basics

### Topics
- Introduction to HTML
- Basic HTML structure
- Common HTML tags (headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists)
- HTML forms

### Textbook Reference
"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, Chapter 18 - Getting Started with Django (introductory HTML section)

### Homework
Create a simple personal webpage using HTML. Your page should include:
1. A header with your name
2. A short bio about yourself
3. A list of your hobbies
4. An image (it can be any image, doesn't have to be of you)
5. A simple contact form (it won't function yet, just the HTML structure)
* Due: Before Lesson 2

## Lesson 2: CSS Basics

### Topics
- Introduction to CSS
- Inline, internal, and external CSS
- CSS selectors
- Basic styling (colors, fonts, margins, padding)
- CSS box model

### Textbook Reference
"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, Chapter 18 - Getting Started with Django (introductory CSS section)

### Homework
Style the HTML page you created in the previous homework:
1. Use an external CSS file
2. Apply different colors and fonts to your page
3. Add margins and padding to elements
4. Make the page responsive (look good on both desktop and mobile)
* Due: Before Lesson 3

## Lesson 3: Introduction to Flask

### Topics
- What is Flask?
- Setting up a Flask environment
- Creating a basic Flask application
- Flask routes and views
- Rendering templates

### Textbook Reference
No direct coverage in the textbooks; Uncle Eric will provide supplementary materials

### Homework
Create a simple Flask application:
1. Set up a basic Flask project
2. Create a home page and an about page
3. Use Flask to serve the HTML file you created in previous homeworks
4. Add a navigation menu to switch between pages
* Due: Before next week's Lesson 1

## Additional Notes
- Remember to bring your laptop to each class with Python installed.
- For this week, make sure you also have a text editor suitable for web development (like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text).
- Don't hesitate to ask Uncle Eric questions during the lessons or via email if you need help.
- Web development opens up a whole new world of possibilities with your Python skills!

## Looking Ahead
Next week, we'll dive deeper into web development with Flask. We'll learn about templates, forms, and how to handle user input. Get ready to create more interactive web applications!
