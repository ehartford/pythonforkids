# Week 7: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics

Welcome to Week 7 of Uncle Eric's Python course! This week, you'll be introduced to Object-Oriented Programming, a powerful paradigm that will change how you think about structuring your code.

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Classes and Objects

### Topics
- What is Object-Oriented Programming?
- Defining classes
- Creating objects (instances of classes)
- Attributes and methods

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 8 - How to Use Classes and Objects

### Homework
Create a simple "Pet" class. Your program should:
1. Define a Pet class with attributes for name, animal type, and age
2. Include methods for making a sound and celebrating a birthday
3. Create several Pet objects and demonstrate their methods
* Due: Before Lesson 2

## Lesson 2: Methods and Self

### Topics
- Instance methods in detail
- The 'self' parameter
- Constructors (__init__ method)
- Class variables vs instance variables

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 8 - How to Use Classes and Objects (continued)

### Homework
Extend the "Pet" class from the previous homework. Add:
1. A constructor (__init__) to set initial values
2. Methods for feeding and playing with the pet
3. A class variable to keep track of the total number of pets created
4. Create a program that simulates a day in the life of several pets
* Due: Before Lesson 3

## Lesson 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism

### Topics
- Inheritance: creating child classes
- Overriding methods
- Polymorphism: using objects of different classes interchangeably
- The 'super()' function

### Textbook Reference
"Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs, Chapter 8 - How to Use Classes and Objects (expanded topics)

### Homework
Create a hierarchy of shape classes:
1. Define a base Shape class with methods for calculating area and perimeter
2. Create child classes for Rectangle, Circle, and Triangle
3. Override the area and perimeter methods for each shape
4. Create a program that creates various shapes and calculates their areas and perimeters
* Due: Before next week's Lesson 1

## Additional Notes
- Remember to bring your laptop to each class with Python installed.
- Don't hesitate to ask Uncle Eric questions during the lessons or via email if you need help.
- Practice coding a little bit each day to reinforce what you've learned.
- OOP can be challenging at first, but it's a very powerful tool once you get the hang of it!

## Looking Ahead
Next week, we'll explore some intermediate Python concepts, including list comprehensions, lambda functions, and regular expressions. These tools will help you write more concise and powerful code. Get ready to level up your Python skills!
